<h1>Ship Sighted!</h1>
<br>
<p class="thick">Upon turning left, the crew shields their eyes from the 
    light of the sun and you continue to stare out into the 
    water. Not too much later does an exclamation sound from
    the crow’s nest. “Ship sighted, port side!”, he declares, 
    and the crew rushes to the left side of the ship, and you 
    nearly lose your balance from the shift in weight. You climb 
    up the steps to the upper deck as your first mate squints his 
    eyes, holding one hand over his brow and the other onto the 
    ship’s wheel. You yourself squint to view the ship’s dark sails
    and elongated hull. You and your crew take a long look as the 
    ship’s bow is angled in front of your trajectory. While your 
    first mate still gazes, he asks, "What should we do, Captain?"
