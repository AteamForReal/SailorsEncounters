<h1>Decline offer from tribe, camp on the beach</h1>
<p class="thick">You kindly decline the offer from the tribe leader under 
    hidden suspicion. You and your crew return to the beach, 
    discussing the manner of the tribe's demeanor. While you 
    are talking with your crew, one among the group waves in 
    front of your face with a finger and signals to quiet down. 
    He points to the beach and you notice several people sleeping 
    around a burnt-out campfire. You look at the shore and see 
    a giant dark ship disguised in the night. You and your crew 
    murmur among yourselves while you tiptoe across the beach. 
    As you approach the ships, someone emerges from the water 
    with a jug in his hand and sword drawn. He waves his weapon 
    around without aim, mumbles a few words loudly, then falls 
    into the sand. You and your crew gaze upon the ship. 
    “Whaddya think we should do with this here, Cap’n?”.
