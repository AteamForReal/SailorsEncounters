<h1>Ship Stolen!</h1>
<p class="thick">You and your crew successfully steal the ship and escape 
    with one more than you had before! All crew is well and 
    you sail off with proper guidance from the pirate’s maps. 
    You and your crew decide to go fishing again with the 
    enhanced equipment from the pirate’s ship. You catch bundles 
    and hordes of trouts, cod, and salmon until your crew grows 
    sore from the work. You return both ships to main land and 
    sell the fish for a fortune. You split the riches with your 
    crew and celebrate at the pub, then return to the pirate 
    ship and sell “The Righteous Pike”. You decide to pursue 
    your dream as a corn cutter (podiatrist).
