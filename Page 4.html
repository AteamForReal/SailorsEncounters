<h1>Redirecting Course...</h1>
<br>
<p class="thick"> Upon turning right, the posture of every crewmate is 
    aligned as soon as the sun warms their backs. Time passes 
    as you maintain your sight on what borders the glistening 
    water and the nearly cloudless sky. The man in the crow’s 
    nest shouts “Land Ho!” as he points slightly towards the 
    starboard. The crew huddles close to the bow as a dark mass 
    appears over the water. You climb up to the deck to get a 
    better look, while the crew whispers amongst themselves. 
    One of the crewmates, out of the ordinary, exclaims “Savage 
    land! We must never journey there!” and starts running towards 
    the left side of the ship to jump. Luckily, a loose rope trips 
    his foot and he falls to the floor. As he tries to recover, one 
    other fellow crewmate apprehends him. He squirms and stirs under 
    his much bigger mate’s grip upon him, until eventually another 
    crewmate knocks him out with a bucket. Your first mate orders them 
    to place him in the brig. While they carry him, your first mate 
    tells you: “Captain, we haven’t felt the sand in a while. It may 
    be good to stop somewhere and just rest and regather what we know 
    about our current situation. Do you agree?”
