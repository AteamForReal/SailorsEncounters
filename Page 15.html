<h1>Offer of the Natives</h1>
<p class="thick">The natives, upon your offer, accept and give you food 
    and supplies for you and your crew. You give them an 
    extended thank you and a series of bows to make sure 
    you respect them. They return as welcome, and offer 
    for you to stay in their homes. You turn to discuss 
    with your crew. “I don’t know, Cap’n”, one of them 
    says, “they could be out to sacrifice us or sumthin”. 
    Another says “With how my back feels, I think it’s worth 
    it to feel a bed again. I say "someone just keep watch 
    and we’ll be alright”. They all look at you for a response.
