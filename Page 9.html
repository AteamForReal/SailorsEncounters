<h1>Discover the tribe</h1>
<p class="thick"> You and the small huddle of crewmates walk into the 
    brush, and follow a sandy path made by nature. Before 
    long, a crewmate looks over to see something red sticking 
    out of a tree. He goes over and plucks it out. “It’s a dart”, 
    he says. You and your crew continue walking, but with 
    increased awareness of your circumstance. Eventually you come 
    upon an open area with several huts surrounding the land. One 
    of your crew taps on your shoulder. He points to the opposite 
    end of the village towards a small group of men approaching 
    slowly. He asks you “What’s the plan, Cap’n? Are we to fraternize 
    with these folk or not?”
