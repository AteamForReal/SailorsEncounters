<h1>Arm Cannons!</h1>
<p class="thick">You command your crew to arm the cannons, but it takes longer 
    to dust them off than to fill them. Half the crew is absent of 
    a weapon, those that are armed load the pistols and prepare their 
    swords. The unarmed half grab spare wood on the ground and chain 
    shot to use as a mace. You get on the deck to make a speech, but 
    before you can spout a single word, you hear a cannon fire in the 
    distance. You look forward and a smoke line is streaming upwards 
    from the pirate ship, and a black bead heads in your direction. 
    Your crew spreads out while one of them yells “Take cover!” You 
    back up to the rear of the ship and watch as the black cannonball 
    sails down… 50 feet off the side of your ship. You exhale, and 
    your crew slowly regains their strength, now aware of their fear.
    The next thing you know in peace is that you’re swimming towards a
    wooden remain of your ship. Your entire crew is still alive as far as you know.
