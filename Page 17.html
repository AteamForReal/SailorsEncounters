<h1>Offer of Recruitment on the beach</h1>
<p class="thick">Two pirates hop off of the ship and walk towards you. 
    The rest of your crew back up the beach while you stand 
    firm. Soon, a ladder is cast over the ship and a coated 
    man descends it. He approaches you. His beard is gray and 
    long, barnacles were growing on the tail of his hat and 
    coat, but his hook blinds everyone with its silver shine. 
    “You the Cap’n?” he asks you, and you nod while you stand 
    a foot from the chrome-hooked man’s seafoam eyes. “I take 
    that as-a-yes”, he says. “Well, I think ya guys arr in 
    quite a tight spot. I can get ya out of it in two ways, 
    but I’ll onleh tell ya one. Accept your new life as a pirate, 
    and you’ll make this a lot easier on yaselves”. 
    The captain fiddles with his hook.</p>
