<h1>The Righteous Pike</h1>
<br>
<p class="thick">Aboard the Merchant Vessel, “The Righteous Pike”, You and your crew have drifted into scarce waters, 
    and you’ve reached the borders of your map. It seems you, as their captain, got a little too ambitious 
    this hunt and the ocean’s current had contrary ideas. As of right now, the ship is nearly idle as the 
    cartographer examines the map with no small amount of shake in his hands and sweat in his brow. Soon, 
    you demand guidance from him as the ship wanders aimlessly in the vast open blue. The cartographer 
    responds, claiming that the current position is a dead zone for astronomical navigation, as it is 
    cloudy often and the stars are few. He recommends being anywhere but here, so he advises that you make
    a decision based on impulse. 
      You go back up to the deck, and your first mate is at the wheel. “We await your command, captain!”
