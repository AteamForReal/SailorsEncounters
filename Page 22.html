<h1>Praised in homage</h1>
<p class="thick">You awake to find both ships gone with half of your crew. 
    You turn to view the border of the forest to face a group 
    of tribal members walking to you. They form a circle around 
    you, pointing their spears towards you and your crew. Before 
    they can enunciate anything, however, the leader calls out, 
    and the tribe lowers their spears slowly. He walks slowly 
    to you and bows before your feet. The remainder of the tribe 
    bows to your crew. “What’s going on?” one of the crew shouts. 
    Another says “I think they think we’re what they were prayin’ 
    about”. They carry you and your crew to the village, where you 
    and your crew are dressed, cleaned, and praised in 
    homage to their god.
