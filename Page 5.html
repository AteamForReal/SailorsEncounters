<h1>Ship gets closer</h1>
<p class="thick">Continuing your ship’s trajectory despite the unexpected 
    encounter, all seems well for a short while. However, 
    you notice that the ship has gotten closer since you 
    spotted them. They seemed to be more in front than on the
    left, as if they were preparing to cut you off. You observe
    the ship at the bow while your crew observes with you. 
    One of the crew next to you points out that they’re raising
    the sails, and upon closer inspection for yourself, you observe 
    the same. Eventually, the man in the crow’s nest shouts for all 
    below to hear: “The colors have risen! Pirate party ahead!”. The 
    crew now stir up panic amongst themselves as you take out your 
    telescope to see for yourself. Sure enough, a flag had been 
    raised, equipped with the trademark of a skull and a silver 
    hook caressing it. As you put away your telescope, you gain 
    the anxious eyes of your crew as they switch between looking 
    at the ship and looking at their captain. Your first mate shouts 
    from the deck, “Orders, sir?”.
