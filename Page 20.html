<h1>Pirates offer you a drink</h1>
<p class="thick">Upon declining the offer, the pirate captain goes back into 
    his quarters and returns with two bottles filled to the neck. 
    He pops the cork and requests that you sip. You slowly take the 
    bottle and sip. You wince back but secretly delight in the 
    drink. The pirate Captain chuckles then snatches the bottle 
    from your grasp with his hook. The pirates offer you what they 
    claim is the “finest ale on this side of the Atlantic”. You 
    turn to your crew and they shrug their shoulders. You turn back 
    and the Captain says “I understand the situation I’ve placed ya 
    in. I’ll let ya think on it should ya accept a few barrels o’ this 
    ‘ere” as he waves the bottle of ale in front of your face.
