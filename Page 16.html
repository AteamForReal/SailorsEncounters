<h1>The Natives driven out</h1>
<p class="thick">Youâ€™ve successfully driven the natives out of the 
    tribe village. You and your crew move into their 
    huts and spend the night stealing their crafted 
    alcohol and rich fruits. When you awake, you decide 
    to journey over to the beach where the ship is docked.
    When you get there, however, the ship is sailing away 
    with the tribe aboard. You run towards the ship and try 
    to grab one of the ropes dangling off of it. The tribe 
    hoists the rope off of the ship and throws a spear into 
    your foot, keeping you immobile. You look in front of the 
    ship and you see a dark ship sailing ahead with a pirate 
    flag. Then you look on the flag of your own ship and spot 
    alliance colors waving in the wind. You and your crew are 
    now stranded on the island.
