<h1>Paradise with the Natives</h1>
<p class="thick">You’ve accepted the tribe’s offer, and now you are 
    staying in their huts. You are given bunks to share 
    with your crew, and showers to clean yourself with. 
    Later in the evening, one of the crew announces that 
    the tribe is having a bonfire, and half of the crew 
    rushes out to join. You decide to join, and the tribe 
    accepts your crew with open jugs and ripe fruits. After 
    a night of partying with the tribe, you and your crew 
    return to the huts. When you awake, however, you find 
    your ship and a pirate ship sailing away. You and your 
    crew decide that paradise dwells here, 
    and you stay with the tribe.
