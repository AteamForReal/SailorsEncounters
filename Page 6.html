<h1>Island Arrival</h1>
<p class="thick">Your crew hastens to dock on the island, and the anchor 
    is dropped in a semicircle bay. Most of your crew jumps 
    overboard into the water to swim for themselves, while 
    few others prepare a rowboat for you. “Don’t bother”, 
    you say, as you toss your coat and captain’s hat in 
    your quarter’s and jump over yourself. 
    On the island, your crew gathers wood from the beach 
    and strikes a fire. A small gathering forms at the border 
    between the grass interior of the island to the sandy 
    exterior. “What be the purpose of your murmuring?”, you 
    ask as you jovially cast your arms on the shoulders of the 
    crew beside you. One of the crew mates responds, “We were 
    just discussing whether we should explore further into them 
    woods there. Might be some food or animals and such. Frederick 
    over there thinks we shouldn’t. He sides with the guy in the 
    brig. He thinks we should just stay on the beach and leave no 
    trace in the morn”. You look over your shoulder at a man sitting 
    on a dead log around the fire, hunched over and rubbing his 
    hands. Your attention is brought back to the huddle when someone 
    else inquires “What do you think we should do, Cap’n?”.
