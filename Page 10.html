<h1>Beach camp</h1>
<p class="thick">The fire made on the beach runs late into the night, 
    and you sit on a log in the circle surrounding it. 
    The cartographer approaches you with several pieces 
    of parchment, and discusses with you possible routes 
    as he points out constellations in the sky that could
    guide us home. Before long, you hear someone near the 
    water cry out “A ship approaches!”. You stand up and 
    walk towards the shore, and you hear the creaking of 
    the wood and the laughing of the people aboard before 
    you can see the size of the hull. You back towards the 
    fire as its light exposes the black sails and the pirate 
    flag waving in the wind. “Whadoo we do, Captain?” several 
    men shout.
