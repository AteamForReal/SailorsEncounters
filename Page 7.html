<h1>White Flag</h1>
<p class="thick"> With haste, your crew hoists the White Flag up the pole 
    as you signal your surrender. As your ship cruises, the 
    black ship turns until its bow points in your direction. 
    You order the first mate to continue the course, and the 
    smaller sails go up to slow your ship’s speed. “I recommend 
    you stay by your quarters, Captain” says the first mate. 
    Ignoring him, you walk down to the bow of your own ship 
    and stare into the distance, where a telescope aboard the 
    dark-sailed ship reflects the sunlight into your eyes. 
    Eventually, the pirates slow to the port side of the ship 
    and board. As a plank is dropped between the two ships, your 
    crew stands on the deck with shaky knees and wide eyes. The 
    pirates only look slightly sloppier than they do, and two 
    cross the plank onto your ship. The crew aboard the dark ship 
    make a path to the plank as a coated figure crosses. His beard 
    is gray and long, barnacles were growing on the tail of his hat 
    and coat, but his hook blinds everyone with its silver shine. 
    “You the Cap’n?” he asks you, and you look behind you to realize 
    your crew has retreated to the starboard side of the ship, opposite 
    of where the pirates boarded, while you stand a foot from the chrome-hooked 
    man’s seafoam eyes. “I take that as-a-yes”, he says. “Well, I 
    think ya guys arr in quite a tight spot. I can get ya out of it in 
    two ways, but I’ll onleh tell ya one. Accept your new life as a 
    pirate, and you’ll make this a lot easier on yaselves”. 
    The captain fiddles with his hook.
