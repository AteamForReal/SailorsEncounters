This game, titled "Sailor's Encounters", is intended for all ages. The content of this game includes pirates, 
<br>
native tribes, and merchant sailor's seeking fortune on the high seas. The only significant mature theme 
<br>
included involves the consumption of alcohol, but there is no explicit drunkeness. Should your child understand
<br>
the risks and factors involved in consuming alcohol, they will be more than suitable to play this game.
