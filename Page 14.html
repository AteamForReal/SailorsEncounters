<h1>Swim to the island</h1>
<p class="thick">You swim towards the smoke stack where you find an island. 
    When you arrive, the crew including yourself are exceedingly 
    tired. You adjust your eyes to a fire alit on the beach. 
    Several people dressed with loincloths and armed with spears 
    dance around the fire and call out in a tongue unknown. You 
    signal your crew to stay quiet while they commit their ritual. 
    Soon, who looks like the tribe leader walks to the center of 
    the circle and holds an idol made of wood over the fire. The 
    people around the circle raise their arms and chant until the 
    leader drops the idol in the fire, and the tribe quiets down. 
    You stand up and make you and your crew visible to the tribe. 
    They see you and form a circle around you, pointing their spears 
    towards you and your crew. Before they can enunciate anything, 
    however, the leader calls out, and the tribe lowers their spears 
    slowly. He walks slowly to you and bows before your feet. The 
    remainder of the tribe bows to your crew. “What’s going on?” one of 
    the crew shouts. Another says “I think they think we’re what they 
    were prayin’ about”. They carry you and your crew to the village, 
    where you and your crew are dressed, cleaned, and praised in 
    homage to their god.
