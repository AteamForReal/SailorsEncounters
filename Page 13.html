<h1>Your new job! Hahahahaha...</h1>
<p class="thick">Your crew signals toward the pirate ship, crying for 
    mercy. The pirate ship abruptly stops, creaking the 
    wood of the hull and splashing the water off the bow. 
    One by one, you and your crew are carried aboard. 
    They apprehend your crew and stuff you all into their 
    shockingly small brig. You fall asleep in the cage and 
    are just glad that you’re going somewhere. When you 
    awaken, you and your crew are hauled off the ship bound 
    with chains on your wrists and ankles. Soon, you stand 
    on a podium with three other of your crew. Still dreary, 
    you see someone in the crowd in front of you yell out 
    something and point at you. When you awake for the second 
    time, You are in royal chambers asleep in a master bed. 
    The decorations are beautiful, the room is wide, and 
    your body is surprisingly…clean. Soon after you awake, 
    someone bursts into your room with colorful clothes in 
    his hand. “Dress up, I expect you in front of the throne 
    in thirty minutes”. He tosses the clothes towards you and 
    they land on the floor with a jingle. You pick up a puffy 
    hat, and hold it up. Parts of the hat angle in different 
    directions and bells jingle off each end. “Oh no” you say. 
    You look behind you and a plaque is nailed to the bed frame:
    “Jester of His Majesty George II”.
