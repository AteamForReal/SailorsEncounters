<h1>Accepted Alliance</h1>
<p class="thick">You have accepted alliance and service to Captain Chrome-Hook, 
    and he welcomes you aboard the ship. Other than a rough branding 
    on the rear and initiation, your crew and yourself seem happy for 
    the time being. You remain with your ship, but now you wave a flag 
    allied with Chrome-Hook’s and a share of the fish you catch has to 
    go to him. He also gives you maps towards the neighboring lands and 
    grants good luck with your hunting. Before you take off, he demands 
    to handle the white flag, and with his hook, he slashes it and throws 
    it into the water. “No quitters for Chrome-Hook. Happy sails.”
